world -> pixel

given point (1, 2) where is that in pixel coords

x goes from -.5 to 5.5. x is 1 into it.
ratio is 0 to 1

ratio = (1 - -.5) / (5.5 - -.5)
ratio = 1.5 / 6
ratio = 1 / 4

now to find x go (1/4) of the distance in world coords.

leftEdge = 300
rightEdge = 700

x = 300 + (700 - 300) * ratio
