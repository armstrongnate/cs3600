2. Vectors
3. Scalars
4. Parametric Form

v is a vector
v = Vector(2, 3, 0)

1. Points
  - Add
    YOU CANT!

  - Scale
    YOU CANT!

2. Vectors
  - Add
    just add x and y

  - Scale
    just multiply scale by x and y

  - Define vector from two points
    v = p2 - p1
    destination minus source

  - add vector and a point
    returns a point

  - Length
    l = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) or l = hypot(a, b) or l = dot(v, v)
    we want vectors to be 1 long, so we must normalize it

  - Normalize
    vNormalized = (x/v.length, y/v.length)

3. Parametric Form
  L(t) = p + v*t

4. Dot product
  u and v are vectors
  dot(u, v) = u.dx * v.dx + u.dy * v.dy
  if the vectors are going in the same direction, the dot product will be 1
  if they are 90 degrees off, dot product will be 0
  180 will be -1
  angle = arcCos(dot)
  only works if vectors are normalized


to normalize a vector: v / length
